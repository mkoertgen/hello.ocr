# Contributing

We love contributions. To get started contributing you might need:

 - [Get started with git](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide)
 - [How to create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
 - [An issue to work on](https://github.com/mkoertgen/hello.ocr/labels/up-for-grabs)

Once you know how to create a pull request and have an issue to work on, just post a comment saying you will work on it.
If you end up not being able to complete the task, please post another comment so others can pick it up.

Issues are also welcome.
